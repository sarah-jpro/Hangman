- Repository: Hangman
- Challenge: solo
- Duration : 3 days

## The mission :smiling_imp:

Make a website version of the hangman word game. To do so try to think the structure, the "backend" (functionality) and the frontend (design) of the project before  start coding.


:clipboard: At the very least the version of the hangman should:
-----------------------------------------------------

* propose an hidden word
* allow the selection of letters
* verify if a selected letter belongs to the word
* count the number of failure (lives)
* check if it's a game over
* check if the word as been found

:closed_lock_with_key: Optionally it can:
------------------

* keep in memory all guessed letters
* only let the player guess a letter once
* add an image for each step
* check keyboard recognition

:tada: Bonus:
------

* use canvas
